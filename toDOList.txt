(more think to use 1. use string method to make more smart 2. make more secure to acsse to anyone beside user)

first 1 month

1. make scnner class                                                          ////DONE////
2. make without userinput naver ending loops (while or for)                   ////DONE//// (done with while loop)
3. make user interaction if and else statement                                ////DONE////
4. make counting if and else statement                                        ////DONE////
5. make every deferance variable path couting and user variable               ////DONE////

(this all things done with in half month now working on second and third month)


to do ting's
6. make system that take any type of user input and work with it 
7. take user counting data and make thare logfile base on month 
8. take user counting data logfile and analyst that data using ML and AI
9. make multi user system and store every user data 
{not much to do try that} try to make android app and make basic system
10. make more smarter system with more user batter system
11. make system to take any type of user input and correct tham to right ting 
{not much to do try that} work with API and all 
{not much to do try that} make more smart android app
12. make user login and singup or logout system
